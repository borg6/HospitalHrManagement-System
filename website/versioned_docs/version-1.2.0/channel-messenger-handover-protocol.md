Since Messenger has become a critical customer support channel between brands and customers, the cooperation between Messenger Bots and human agents creates a complete customer journey on messaging business.

Here comes the Messenger handover protocol, which aims to make a smooth transition between Messenger Bots and human agents in the compact Messenger window. Technically speaking, this protocol allows a Facebook Page simultaneously owns multiple Facebook Apps, e.g., a Facebook app for auto-reply, and another Facebook app for human agents support.
