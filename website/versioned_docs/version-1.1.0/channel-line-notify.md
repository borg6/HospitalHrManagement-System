## What is LINE Notify

[LINE Notify](https://notify-bot.line.me) is a LINE service that lets you send notifications to the subscribed users. Once a user subscribed to your service on LINE Notify, the user will become friends with LINE Notify automatically and you can send messages to the user through LINE Notify without extra cost.

## How to Use LINE Notify in Bottender

If you want to have a clean project with LINE Notify, you could start from [this example](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tree/master/examples/line-notify) to develop your project. You can follow the following four steps to create your project:

1. Download the code from [`line-notify` example](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tree/master/examples/line-notify).
