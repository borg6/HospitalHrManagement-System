This guide will give you some basic concepts of developing a Messenger bot. For more detail, see [official docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform).

## Requirements

To develop a Messenger bot, you need the following requirements:

- A Page Access Token
- An App Secret

In order to get Page Access Token and App secret, you need:

- [A Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/)
- [A Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/)

After you get a Facebook Page and a Facebook App, you can get the `Page Access Token`. Check the [official docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup).
Also, remember to copy the `App Secret` on app dashboard. Click `Show` button on the dashboard and type your password to get the App Secret.

Before leaving this section, make sure you have the following requirements:

- A Page Access Token
- An App Secret

We will use them to develop our messenger bot later.
